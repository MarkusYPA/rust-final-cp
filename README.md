# Rust Final CP

Practice solving exercises listed to appear in the exam.

## How to Use

1. Choose an exercise and navigate to its folder
2. 

## Folder contents

Each src/ subfolder contains all the important files
- lib.rs: Write your answer here (exception: brackets_matching, where you write it in main.rs)
- main.rs:  Runs your code with modifiable inputs
- tests.rs:  Actual tests the code needs to pass
- solution01edu.txt: Example solution from the system
- solutionm: Solution I devised 
- template.txt: The base for the exercise as it is given on the platform


## Notes

Copy contents of template.txt over lib.rs (keep the tests bit at the bottom!) to be sure to have the exercise as it will appear on the platform. lib.rs has often been modified to avoid VSCode's rust-analyzer giving red compiler error warnings.
